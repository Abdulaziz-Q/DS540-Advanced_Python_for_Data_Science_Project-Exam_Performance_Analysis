# DS540-final_project
DS510 Advanced Python for Data Science is one of the master's courses 

#### This was final project of Advanced Python for Data Science course
#### Below is the project requirements:

#### Project: Exam performance analysis
You are requested to analyse students’ exam performance dataset using
python programming language. The dataset contains students’ scores in
three different subjects (math, reading, and writing). Wire a python program
to perform the following tasks:

**Task 1:** Load the dataset in relevant format and show its properties, e.g.
number of records, number of features and their types. (hint: use Pandas
Library to read the data). Inspect the dataset and perform data cleaning (e.g.
removing duplicate records and fixing missing data).

**Task 2:** Provide descriptive statistics of the dataset and perform an
exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer the following analysis questions:
- Compare students’ exam scores in different subjects (math, reading,
writing), What trend did you find?
- Who performed better in different subjects male or female students?
- Show any attributes (features) that are correlated with exam scores.
(e.g. Does parental level of education affect their children exam
scores? Does test preparation influence students’ performance?)
(hint: use corr() method in Pandas).

(you are encouraged to impose other analysis questions based on any trend
you notice in the dataset).

**Task 3:** Show visual representation of your analysis (hint: use data
visualization packages such as Matplotlib and Seaborn).

**Task 4:** Build a machine learning model to predict student’s exam
performance in each subject given the following attributes: gender,
race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, and test preparation
course.
